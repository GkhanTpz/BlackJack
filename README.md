# Blackjack Game in Python

A Python-based command-line Blackjack game where you can play against a computer dealer. This game allows the player to draw cards, decide to "Hit" or "Stay," and attempt to beat the dealer without exceeding 21 points.

## Features

- **Dealer and Player Logic:** The player can choose to "Hit" or "Stay," while the dealer follows preset rules.
- **Face Cards and Ace Logic:** Face cards are valued at 10, and the Ace can be 1 or 11 depending on the player's choice.
- **Realistic Gameplay:** Includes a hidden card for the dealer until the player's turn is over.
- **Replay Option:** The player can choose to play multiple rounds.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GkhanTpz/BlackJack.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd BlackJack
   ```
3. **Run the Game:**
   ```bash
   python blackjack.py
   ```

## Game Rules

- The objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- The dealer must draw cards until they reach at least 17.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points.
- If the player's total is closer to 21 than the dealerâ€™s without exceeding 21, the player wins.
