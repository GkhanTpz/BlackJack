## üîç Function Explanations

### `card.py`
- **`draw_hand(number, include_faces_card=True)`**: Draws a specified number of cards, returning them as a formatted string. The `include_faces_card` parameter determines if face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are included.
- **`draw_card(include_faces_card=True)`**: Draws a single card with a rank and suit, based on the `include_faces_card` parameter.
- **`get_suit()`**: Randomly selects a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, or Clubs) for a card.
- **`get_rank(include_faces_card=True)`**: Generates a rank for a card, choosing between numbers (2-10) or face cards depending on the parameter.

### `score.py`
- **`calculate_hand(person, card_count, is_dealer=False)`**: Calculates the total score for the player's or dealer's hand by drawing `card_count` cards. If `is_dealer` is `True`, only one card is displayed initially.
  
### `dealer.py`
- **`dealer_hand(cards)`**: Evaluates the dealer‚Äôs cards, assigning values based on rank. Face cards are worth 10, Aces are 11, and number cards are their numeric value.

### `player.py`
- **`player_hand(cards)`**: Evaluates the player‚Äôs cards, assigning values based on rank. For an Ace, it prompts the player to choose its value (1 or 11). Other cards are valued according to their rank.

### `result.py`
- **`show_hand(person, person_hand, total_score)`**: Displays each card in a person's hand, followed by their total score.
- **`show_result(player_total_score, dealer_total_score)`**: Displays the outcome of the game, determining the winner based on the player‚Äôs and dealer‚Äôs total scores.
