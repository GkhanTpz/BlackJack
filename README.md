## Blackjack Game Code Explanation

This Python code simulates a simple Blackjack game between a player and a dealer. It uses basic rules to calculate the value of each hand, allowing the player to hit or stay, and the dealer to play according to the game logic.

### Functions

### `draw_hand(number, include_faces_card=True)`
- **Purpose:** Generates a hand of cards.
- **Parameters:** 
  - `number`: The number of cards to draw.
  - `include_faces_card`: If `True`, the hand may include face cards (Jack, Queen, King).
- **Returns:** A string representing the cards in the hand.
- **How it works:** Calls `draw_card()` for each card, appending it to the hand.

### `draw_card(include_faces_card=True)`
- **Purpose:** Draws a single card by combining a rank (like "Ace", "2", "King") and a suit (like "Hearts", "Clubs").
- **Parameters:**
  - `include_faces_card`: If `True`, the card may be a face card.
- **Returns:** A string representing a single card (e.g., "King of Hearts").

### `get_suit()`
- **Purpose:** Randomly selects a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs).
- **Returns:** A string representing the suit of the card.

### `get_rank(include_faces_card=True)`
- **Purpose:** Generates the rank of a card.
- **Parameters:**
  - `include_faces_card`: If `True`, includes ranks like Jack, Queen, and King.
- **Returns:** A string representing the rank of the card (e.g., "Ace", "7", "King").

### `blackjack_player(card)`
- **Purpose:** Determines the value of a player's card.
- **Parameters:** 
  - `card`: A string representing the card drawn.
- **Returns:** 
  - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
  - The player chooses if Ace is worth 1 or 11.
  - All other cards return their numeric value.

### `blackjack_dealer(card)`
- **Purpose:** Determines the value of a dealer's card.
- **Parameters:** 
  - `card`: A string representing the card drawn.
- **Returns:** 
  - Face cards are worth 10 points.
  - Aces are always worth 11 points (for simplicity).

### Game Logic

### `game()`
- **Purpose:** Main function to simulate a round of Blackjack between the player and the dealer.
- **How it works:**
  1. **Dealer’s Initial Hand:**
     - The dealer is dealt 2 cards, but only one is shown (the other is hidden).
     - If the first card is an Ace, the dealer is forced to redraw to avoid starting with two Aces.
  2. **Player’s Hand:**
     - The player is dealt 2 cards, and their total hand value is calculated using `blackjack_player()`.
  3. **Player Hits or Stays:**
     - The player can "Hit" (take another card) or "Stay" (end their turn).
     - If the player "Hits," their total hand value is updated until they choose to stay or their value reaches/exceeds 21.
  4. **Dealer’s Turn:**
     - The dealer draws cards until their hand value reaches at least 17.
     - The dealer’s hand value is updated with each new card.
  5. **Endgame and Result:**
     - The game compares the player’s and dealer’s hand values.
     - If the values are the same, it's a draw.
     - If the player has a higher value or the dealer goes over 21 (busts), the player wins.
     - If the dealer has a higher value without busting, the dealer wins.

### Example Game Flow:
1. **Dealer’s hand:** The dealer draws two cards, one is hidden.
2. **Player’s hand:** The player draws two cards and decides to "Hit" or "Stay".
3. **Dealer’s turn:** The dealer draws cards until their total hand value is at least 17.
4. **Game result:** The player wins if their hand value is greater than the dealer's or if the dealer busts.

This code models the core elements of Blackjack, with some simplified rules for ease of play.
