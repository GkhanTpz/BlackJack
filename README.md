# Blackjack Game in Python üÉè

A text-based Blackjack game written in Python, where you compete against a computer-controlled dealer. This project demonstrates key programming principles, like loops, conditionals, and functions, in a fun and interactive way.

## üéÆ Game Overview

The objective of the game is to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding it. The player and dealer are each dealt an initial hand of two cards, with the player‚Äôs cards fully visible and only one of the dealer's cards revealed. Players can then choose to "Hit" to draw additional cards or "Stay" to keep their hand as it is. The dealer must draw cards according to the rules until their hand value reaches 17 or more.

The game ends when the player or dealer reaches 21, goes over 21, or decides to stop drawing cards. The winner is determined based on the final hand values.

## üìè Game Rules

1. **Initial Deal:** Both the player and the dealer receive two cards.
2. **Objective:** Try to reach a score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
3. **Card Values:**
   - **Face Cards (Jack, Queen, King):** Worth 10 points each.
   - **Number Cards:** Worth their respective numbers.
   - **Ace:** Worth 1 or 11 points, depending on the player's choice.
4. **Player's Turn:**
   - **Hit:** The player draws a new card.
   - **Stay:** The player ends their turn and keeps their current hand.
5. **Dealer's Turn:** 
   - The dealer reveals their hidden card and draws additional cards until their total score is at least 17.
6. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the player exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose.
   - If the dealer exceeds 21, the dealer busts, and the player wins.
   - If neither busts, the hand closer to 21 wins. A score of exactly 21 with the initial two cards is a "Blackjack" and is an automatic win.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Function Explanations

### `card.py`

- **`draw_hand(number, include_faces_card=True)`**: This function draws a specified number of cards (`number`). By default, it includes face cards (Jack, Queen, King). It calls the `draw_card()` function to generate individual cards and returns them as a formatted string.

- **`draw_card(include_faces_card=True)`**: This function generates a single card with both a rank and suit. The `include_faces_card` parameter determines whether face cards are included in the deck.

- **`get_suit()`**: This function randomly selects a suit for the card. The possible suits are **Hearts**, **Diamonds**, **Spades**, and **Clubs**.

- **`get_rank(include_faces_card=True)`**: This function generates a random rank for the card. If `include_faces_card` is `True`, the rank can be any of the numbers (2‚Äì10) or the face cards (Jack, Queen, King). Otherwise, the rank is restricted to numbers between 2 and 10.

---

### `score.py`

- **`calculate_hand(person, card_count, is_dealer=False)`**: This function calculates the total score for a person‚Äôs hand (`person`) by drawing a specified number of cards (`card_count`). The `is_dealer` flag determines if the person is the dealer. If it's the dealer's hand, only one card is shown, and the other is hidden.

---

### `dealer.py`

- **`dealer_hand(cards)`**: This function processes the cards in the dealer‚Äôs hand and returns their value. Face cards are worth 10 points, Aces are worth 11 points, and numbered cards hold their face value.

---

### `player.py`

- **`player_hand(cards)`**: This function evaluates the player's cards and determines their total score. For an Ace, the player is prompted to choose between 1 or 11. The function ensures valid input and adjusts the score accordingly.

---

### `result.py`

- **`show_hand(person, person_hand, total_score)`**: This function displays the cards in the hand of the specified person (`person`), followed by their total score.

- **`show_result(player_total_score, dealer_total_score)`**: This function displays the outcome of the game, comparing the player‚Äôs score to the dealer‚Äôs. It announces whether the player wins, loses, or if the game results in a draw.
