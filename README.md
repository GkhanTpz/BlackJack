## üéÆ Game Overview

The objective of the game is to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding it. The player and dealer are each dealt an initial hand of two cards, with the player‚Äôs cards fully visible and only one of the dealer's cards revealed. Players can then choose to "Hit" to draw additional cards or "Stay" to keep their hand as it is. The dealer must draw cards according to the rules until their hand value reaches 17 or more.

The game ends when the player or dealer reaches 21, goes over 21, or decides to stop drawing cards. The winner is determined based on the final hand values.

## üìè Game Rules

1. **Initial Deal:** Both the player and the dealer receive two cards.
2. **Objective:** Try to reach a score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
3. **Card Values:**
   - **Face Cards (Jack, Queen, King):** Worth 10 points each.
   - **Number Cards:** Worth their respective numbers.
   - **Ace:** Worth 1 or 11 points, depending on the player's choice.
4. **Player's Turn:**
   - **Hit:** The player draws a new card.
   - **Stay:** The player ends their turn and keeps their current hand.
5. **Dealer's Turn:** 
   - The dealer reveals their hidden card and draws additional cards until their total score is at least 17.
6. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the player exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose.
   - If the dealer exceeds 21, the dealer busts, and the player wins.
   - If neither busts, the hand closer to 21 wins. A score of exactly 21 with the initial two cards is a "Blackjack" and is an automatic win.
